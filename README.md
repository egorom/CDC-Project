# CDC-Project


## Background

### Many infectious diseases like Covid-19 can be modeled using an SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model or one of its variants. The models in this project are typically a set of 3 or 4 ODEs that must be solved numerically.

## Goal

### Create a front-end GUI where users can interact with parameter values for the chosen SIR model. The ODE will be solved numerically on the back-end from these paramter values. From the solution, a graph is output for the user to gain knowledge from regarding the disease.

### The hope for this project is that it will be useful for healthcare professionals (who specifically?) to utilize (to gain more knowledge regarding what to expect given the current trends in the disease? when?).
